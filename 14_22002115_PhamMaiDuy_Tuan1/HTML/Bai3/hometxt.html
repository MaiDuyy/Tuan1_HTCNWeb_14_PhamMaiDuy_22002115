      <p><span style="color: brown">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the
         Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on
         rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have
         gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
      <p>I've started putting up a <a href="Silde1.html">slide show</a> of the
         production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
         If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please 
         contact me.</p>
      <p>Once again: <span style="color:brown"><i>BRAVO!!!</i></span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
