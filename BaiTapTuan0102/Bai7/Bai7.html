          />A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the
          muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 80
          muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at
          the corner of the eyes an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles
          performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
